This poject started as a way for force myself to learn about data visualization and D3. <br>
Soon I realized that people working in datavis is using **observable**, so I decided to move the development and experiments there. In the folder *FirstDraf* you can find the initial development I was using. I will include in this repo all the code I produce in observable, every observable notebook will be a folder. <br>
You can see my [Observable Account](https://observablehq.com/@orlando-sabogal). See [this notebook](https://observablehq.com/@orlando-sabogal/mobility-patterns-i) for the desire lines.
